Avoid the resume black hole
----------------------------
Often, out of 500 applicants, just 1 person gets the job. 

Tips:
- Include links to apps you developed (e.g. App Store)
- Include links to GitHub repos (even small projects)
- use HackerRank

Get there first
 - 80% hires are from first 20% applicants
 - use Indeed.com alerts


Connect with Recruiter or Hiring Manager on LinkedIn
 - Send short message. e.g.:n"I just applied for job #333. Would love to hear how I can talk to the right person." 
 - Be proactive. Recruiter likes it when people reach out directly.

Get referred!

Type of referral and the Screened-to-Hired ratio
----------------------------------------------
Trusted referral 5:1 
Employee referral 12:1
Direct sourced (recruiter found you because your skills match) 50:1 
Rank and File apply 125:1
Top Tier apply (usually don't apply for top-tier jobs, you'd get promoted) >250:1


Interviews (Moving down the funnel)
-------------------------------------

From the recruiter's point of view:

Phone screen or video chat
- Do they have basic skills?
- Should we bring them onsite for interview?

Onsite Interview
- Can you do it?
	- Knowledge, experience, competencies (skills and behavior)
- Will you do it?
	- Motivations
- Can we work together?
	- Drivers - your values
	- Traits - natural tendencies e.g. assertiveness or risk taking



Phone screen
-------------
Communication is non-verbal, so on a phone screen, be conscious of not talking to fast, being articulate, listen for the question before you start to answer. 
Have a list of questions to ask interviewers.


On-site
----------

Interview Questions
Group A - not useful
 - Tell me about yourself
 - Describe last job

 Group B - not useful
  - If you were shrunk to the size of a nickel, put in a blender and told the blades would start spinning on one minute, what would you do?
  (Trick/creative questions are falling out of fashion)

 Group C (Behavioral Question - past as predictor of future)
 - Did you ever fail to meet a deadline? What happened and why?
 - Describe a time you had to deal with a difficult customer or coworker.
 - What has been your biggest challenge in your professional career so far?

 STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Results) Questions
 Creativity/Innovativeness
 * What innovation procedures have you developed? How? Who was involved? What change did they make?

 Evaluating Past Performace
 * Once major prpblem we're now facing is ____. What have you don that is the most similar? How would you go about it?

 Judgement, Negoitation Skills, Persuasiveness, Resolving Conflict, Development People, Leadership, Customer Orientation


Really looking for learners, people who can grow.


Typical Career Path
---------------------
Expect twists and turns.
Recommendation: Steve Jobs commencement speech to Stanford 2005. Read it (don't watch the video).
Try a bunch of stuff.
Don't be afraid to experiment.
Jobs vs. Career
Job is like a subway stop. Career is the subway line.

Where are you going?
Are you running away from something or running to something? Recruiter making sure you know what you want.


What do I like to do? (Interests)
What is available? (Opportunities)
What am I good at? (Skills)
...The sweet spot is the overlap of these 3.


Summary
-----------
Recruiters are overwhelmed with resumes
Create a compelling profile
Avoid the black hole of resumes
Understand the types of interview questions
Experiemnt with different job types
Have a forward looking story.


Q&A
----
How to start a start-up 
- Steven Blank has entrepreunership class at Stanford.

How often stay connected to people after you leave a company? 
- Often.

Resume length
- No 5-page resumes! A recruiter will spend 6 seconds on a resume.
Don't be funny on your resume.
Showing is better than telling - links to github, etc.

Does school matter for a job (community college vs. ivy league) ? 
- After 4 years in the workforce your school/GPA has no bearing on career. Experience matters more. Halo effect (bias towards reputable schools) is stronger in early career. 
Some companies have GPA cut-offs.

How improve chances of getting resume seen
Oath has an applicant-tracking system (automated resume-reader)
They look back at old resumes in the system.
